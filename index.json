I am a Professor of Economics at University College Dublin. My research is in applied microeconomics, with a strong focus on human capital. I address three main research questions: Migration: How does international migration affect the lives of migrants and natives? Environment: How does the environment, especially pollution, affect skill formation and decision making? Education: How do peers affect a person\u0026#39;s decisions and outcomes? I answer these questions with causal inference techniques and a combination of survey, regional, and administrative data. I am passionate about teaching econometrics and data analytics. I run a YouTube channel with over 70 videos on causal inference and public economics. At the moment, I am piloting intuitivemetrix.com, a platform that teaches econometrics through animations, videos, and simple explanations. Stay tuned for that!. I am also in the process of creating a new MSc Course Causal Inference and Policy Evaluation, which will be offered for the first time in spring 2024. For my contribution to teaching and learning, I have recently received the Teaching Excellence Award by the UCD College of Social Sciences and Law. Since joining UCD in 2018, I have built the structured MLitt/PhD Programme in Economics -- the only structured PhD programme in economics in Ireland -- and the M.Sc Economics and Data Analytics, which launches in 2023. Before joining UCD, I spent five wonderful years at the Institute of Labor Economics (IZA) in Bonn/Germany, where I remain involved as a Research Fellow. I am a co-editor of the journal Research in Labor Economics.

After World War~II, eight million expelled Germans arrived in West Germany within five years. We use regional variation in the population share of forced migrants across West German cities to estimate the effect of this inflow on cities' taxation and spending decisions. To identify a causal effect, we pursue an instrumental variable strategy that leverages push factors of the expulsions while being orthogonal to local conditions in the destination regions. Our results show that cities with high inflows of forced migrants increased spending on welfare and education, decreased spending on infrastructure, raised local taxes, and incurred more debt. Part of these effects can be attributed to shifts in political preferences. The migrants held voting rights upon arrival and supported parties that explicitly catered to their interests and needs.","tags":null,"title":"Forced Migration and Local Public Policies: Evidence from Post-War West Germany","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emanuele Albarosa","Benjamin Elsner"],"categories":null,"content":"This paper was written as part of the project Preventing Social Conflict and Promoting Social Cohesion in Forced Displacement Contexts funded by the World Bank, UK Aid and the UNHCR\n","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"67374d12e1c80534489524a9fdaa99af","permalink":"https://benjaminelsner.com/publication/albarosaelsner2023/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/albarosaelsner2023/","section":"publication","summary":"A commonly expressed concern about immigration is that it undermines social cohesion in the receiving country. In this paper, we study the impact of a large and sudden inflow of asylum seekers on several indicators of social cohesion. In 2015/16, over one million asylum seekers from Syria, Afghanistan, and elsewhere arrived in Germany. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this inflow changed the public opinion on hosting asylum seekers, from being highly welcoming to fairly negative within a few months. Using individual- and county-level panel data, we test whether the evidence supports this apparent shift in attitudes. In a difference-in-differences design, we compare the attitudes of individuals in areas with large vs. small local inflows before and after the inflow. In individual survey data, we find mixed evidence of an impact on social cohesion. In a representative sample, we find no evidence that the inflow undermined social cohesion, except for a negative effect on donations to charity. In areas with high vote shares for the populist party AfD, we find that the inflow led to greater anti-immigrant sentiment and a greater concern about crime. We also show that areas with larger increases in the number of asylum seekers experienced a significant increase in anti-immigrant violence, which lasted for about two years before returning to its pre-inflow level. This effect was larger in areas with higher unemployment and greater support for AfD.","tags":null,"title":"Forced Migration and Social Cohesion: Evidence from the 2015/16 Mass Inflow in Germany","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Elsner","Jeff Concannon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"cc36ba161f414a0b153258f5bb889bb5","permalink":"https://benjaminelsner.com/publication/elsnerconcannon2022/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/elsnerconcannon2022/","section":"publication","summary":"This","tags":null,"title":"Immigration and Redistribution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Elsner","Florian Wozny"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"33f7b84e95cc82bb3901a0601ae5f4b0","permalink":"https://benjaminelsner.com/publication/elsnerwozny2023/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/elsnerwozny2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

We use data from 60 federal and state elections in Germany from 2000 to 2018 and exploit plausibly exogenous fluctuations in ambient air pollution within counties across election dates. Higher air pollution on election day shifts votes away from incumbent parties and towards opposition parties. An increase in the concentration of particulate matter (PM10) by 10 micrograms per cubic meter -- around two within-county standard deviations -- reduces the vote share of incumbent parties by two percentage points, which is equivalent to 4% of the mean vote share. We generalize these findings by documenting similar effects with data from a weekly opinion poll and a large-scale panel survey. We provide further evidence that emotions are a likely mechanism: the survey data show that poor air quality leads to greater anxiety and unhappiness, which may reduce the support for the political status quo. Overall, these results suggest that poor air quality affects decision-making in the population at-large, which has far-reaching knock-on effects on society.","tags":null,"title":"The Political Fallout of Air Pollution","type":"workingpaper"},{"authors":["Benjamin Elsner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"f383de7e081e7cca57fbae25833a63bc","permalink":"https://benjaminelsner.com/publication/izawol2015/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/izawol2015/","section":"publication","summary":"This article provides and overview of research findings on the impact of emigration on wages.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Does Emigration Increase the Wages of Non-emigrants in Sending Countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"This video series comprises of 50 videos on Public Economics at the undergraduate level.

While a large literature has identified the causes of self-selection, we turn in this paper to the consequences. Using a combination of non-parametric econometrics and calibrated simulation, we quantify the impact of migrant self-selection on per-capita GDP in both sending and receiving countries. Two episodes of mass migration serve as examples: the migration from Norway to the US in the 1880s and the migration from Mexico to the US in the 2000s. We first estimate the degree of selection, and show that Norwegians were positively and Mexicans negatively selected. In a simulation exercise, we compare the economy under selective migration with a counterfactual in which the same number of migrants are neutrally selected. In both periods, we find virtually no aggregate effect in the US. Findings are different for the sending countries; migrant selection decreases Norwegian GDP by 0.3%, and increases Mexican GDP by almost 1%. While these effects may appear small, we demonstrate that the effect in Mexico is as large as the difference between no migration and the current level of migration.","tags":null,"title":"Let's Be Selective about Migrant Self-Selection","type":"workingpaper"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Test Test Test\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f14fa52f45a615a62ab3c101e6157df1","permalink":"https://benjaminelsner.com/teaching/teaching/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/teaching/","section":"teaching","summary":"Test Test Test","tags":null,"title":"","type":"teaching"}]
